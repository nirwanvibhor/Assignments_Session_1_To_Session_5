# Data-Science-Masters_Python_Assignment-1
The assignement comprises creating a source code for the following problems. 

Problem Statement:  PYTHON 1

(Python1_Assignment1)- Install Jupyter notebook and run the first program and share the screenshot of the output

(Python1_Assignment2) - Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line  

(Python1_Assignment3) - Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name 

(Python1_Assignment4) - Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm. Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

Problem Statement:  PYTHON 2 

(Python2_Assignment1) - Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list.  
(Python2_Assignment2) - Create a pattern using nested for loop in Python.   
(Python2_Assignment3) - Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.    
(Python2_Assignment4) - Write a Python Program to print the given string in the format specified. 

Problem Statement:  PYTHON 3 

(Python3_Assignment1) 
1.1) Write a Python Program to implement your own myreduce() function which works exactly like Python's built-in function reduce()  
1.2) Write a Python program to implement your own myfilter() function which works exactly like Python's built-in function filter()  

(Python3_Assignment2) - Implement List comprehensions to produce the following lists.
(Python3_Assignment3) - Implement a function longestWord() that takes a list of words and returns the longest one.

Problem Statement:  PYTHON 4

(Python4_Assignment1.1) - Write a Python Program(with class concepts) to find the area of the triangle using the below formula.  
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5  
Function to take the length of the sides of triangle from user should be defined in the parent class and function to calculate the area should be defined in subclass.  

(Python4_Assignment1.2) - Write a function filter_long_words() that takes a list of words and an integer n and returns the list of words that are longer than n.  

(Python4_Assignment2.1) - Write a Python program using function concept that maps list of words into a list of integers representing the lengths of the corresponding words.  
    
(Python4_Assignment2.2) - Write a Python function which takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise

Problem Statement:  PYTHON 5   
(Python5_Assignment1) - Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.  

(Python5_Assignment2) - Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["Americans", "Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in ["Baseball","cricket"].
